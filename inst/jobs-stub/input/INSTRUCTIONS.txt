Instructions for the input/ subdirectory
-----------------------------------------

Do *not* put jobs here! 

The input/ directory is for common data and other input.

Of course, data may be store in the current directory,
which means inside the job directory currently running,
or in any other directory. The input/ is added for 
conveniency.

Note that the input/ directory may be replace with a 
link, that is, a soft link on Unix or a Windows shortcut 
on Windows.
