Instructions for the running/ subdirectory
------------------------------------------

Do *not* put jobs here! 

Batch jobs found in the todo/ directory will be moved here 
automatically when started. A job remains in the running/
directory as long as it is running. Depending on if it was 
successful or not, it is moved to the finished/, failed/ 
or interrupted/ directories.

Note: A killed job due to core dumps, power black-out, SIGTERM 
and so on will *not* be moved to the failed/ directory. For this 
reason it might be necessary to once in a while check the running/
directory for "dead" jobs. If found, they can safely be moved to 
the todo/ directory in order to re-run.

When a job is processed, the running/ directory is the job's
current/working directory. For instance, if data files are
put the jobs/data/ directory, that directory can be accessed
by ../data/ from the jobs/running/ directory. 

If the R.io::File() class is used, Windows shortcuts (*.lnk) files 
are "followed" emulating the same behaviour as soft links in Unix.
Thus, by creating a jobs/data.lnk shortcut, data do not have to 
be copied.
