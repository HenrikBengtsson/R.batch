Instructions for the failed/ subdirectory
-----------------------------------------

Do *not* put jobs here! 

Batch jobs that failed are automatically moved to this directory.
A batch job that generates an error that is not caught is
considered to fail. 

Note: Failure due to core dumps, power black-out or if the process
is killed (with SIGTERM) the batch job will not be moved to this 
directory.
