Instructions for the output/ subdirectory
-----------------------------------------

Do *not* put jobs here! 

The output/ directory is a common place for all jobs where
they can store estimates, results, images etc.

Of course, output may be store in the current directory,
which means inside the job directory currently running,
or in any other directory. The output/ is added for 
conveniency.

Note that the output/ directory may be replace with a 
link, that is, a soft link on Unix or a Windows shortcut 
on Windows.
