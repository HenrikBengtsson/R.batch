Instructions for the todo/ subdirectory
---------------------------------------

Put your job**/ *directories*, which contains jobs to be done,
in this subdirectory. 

Each job**/ directory may contain a SETTINGS file plus R files (named *.R) 
that contain source code specific to the job. Note that general source
code to be reused by all batch jobs, is better put in the src/ directory.

When a batch job is started, it first moved to the running/ directory.
