Instructions for the interrupted/ subdirectory
----------------------------------------------

Do *not* put jobs here! 

Batch jobs that are interrupted are automatically moved to 
this directory. 

A job can be interrupted by Ctrl-C, if run interactively. 
If run non-interactive, the job can be interrupted by 
sending SIGINT signal. Under Unix, this can be done by
"pkill -INT ...". Do not use SIGTERM, because then the
process is killed instantaniously.
