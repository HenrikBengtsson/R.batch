Description: The package provides methods to batch run R scripts in a straightforward manner. A job batch is defined by a root directory containing subdirectories todo/, running/, finished/, failed/, src/ among others. A job to be processed is a directory placed in todo/. A job is processed by moving it to running/, then sourcing the R files in src/ (containing common code) and then the ones in the job directory (contain job specific code), in which a function onRun() has to be defined, which is then called. Succesfully jobs end up in finished/ whereas failed jobs in failed/.
