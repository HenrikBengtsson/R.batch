Package: R.batch
================

Version: 0.6.2 [2014-06-16]
o CLEANUP: Fixed up DESCRIPTION.
o BUG FIX: The example("JobBatch") would give error on '... could 
  not find function "devOptions"', because it assumed that src/
  filenames were sorted the same way on all systems.


Version: 0.6.1 [2012-12-16]
o CLEANUP: Using getEnvironment(this) instead of this$.env when
  'this' is an R.oo::Object.


Version: 0.6.0 [2012-12-16]
o Package now passes R CMD check on R v2.15.0.
o Added a NAMESPACE and added to 'BuildKeepEmpty: TRUE' DESCRIPTION.
o DOCUMENTATION: Minor updates of help pages.
o CRAN POLICY: Removed an indirectly defined .Internal() call.
o CLEANUP: Updated the job batch example code to utilize R.devices.
o CLEANUP: Updated the scripts in system.file("bin", package="R.batch").


Version: 0.5.0 [2009-11-01]
o Added static setupDemo() of JobBatch.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added help on how to automatically add 
  the bin/ directory of the R.batch package to the search path.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now the state of verbose identation is 
  preserved when exiting functions.
o CLEAN UP: Renamed the jobs-ex/ directory to jobs-mandelbrot/.
o CLEAN UP: Renamed the misc/ directory to bin/.
o Updated the package dependencies.


Version: 0.4.6 [2009-06-06]
o BUG FIX: "Unnamed" argument 'list' in all substitute(..., list=...). 
o BUG FIX: example(JobBatch) tried to set obsolete graphics parameter
  'par.ask.default' (replaced by 'device.ask.default').
o CLEAN UP: Now the package startup message is generated using
  packageStartupMessage() so that it can be silenced using options.
o CLEAN UP: Renamed HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 0.4.5 [2006-09-19]
o BUG FIX: Argument 'details' in main() of JobBatch must be converted
  explicitly to a character before calling toupper().  This must be 
  due to a change in R.


Version: 0.4.4 [2006-09-12]
o Removed the code that patched capabilities() temporarily while
  loading job scripts.  See source of Job.R for more details.


Version: 0.4.3 [2006-01-21]
o Although R CMD check passes without errors and warnings, there
  are still quite a few methods that has to be carefully documented.
o Added help for clean() in JobBatch.


Version: 0.4.2 [2005-11-28]
o Added argument 'maxJobs' to JobBatch$main() and thus also to the
  shell script RJobBatch.  This allows you to process any number
  of jobs before quitting.  With maxJobs=Inf, the process will run
  forever until being interrupted.  If no jobs are available, it
  will recheck after 'sleepTime' seconds.


Version: 0.4.1 [2005-10-20]
o BUG FIX: Job() would generate an error. This prevented the Rdoc 
  compiler to run etc.
o Removed obsolete "suggested" package R.graphics.


Version: 0.4.0 [2005-05-30]
o This package no longer dependends on packages R.basic, R.lang and R.io, 
  but instead on the new R.utils package to which several file utility
  methods but also the System class has been moved. To make the example
  code independent of R.graphics, its findPngDevice() function was
  cut'n'pasted into the source code of the example batch.


Version: 0.3.4 [2005-05-29]
o Now all fields of the Job class are persistent, that is, they are
  immediately stored to file when modified, e.g. .persistent/.status.
  This makes it possible to recreate a Job in a new R session for the
  purpose of for instance checking the status.
o Added a *trial* version of having requirements to Job:s. If a file named
  .Requirements.R is found in src/ or a job directory, it is immediately
  source():ed by JobBatch before any other source code. If that file
  returns TRUE, the JobBatch continues, otherwise it tries the next
  until all jobs has been processed.


Version: 0.3.3 [2005-03-28]
o Added support for additional input paths "input2/", "input3/" etc.
  See help getInputPath() in the Job class.


Version: 0.3.2 [2005-03-11]
o Added setLabel().
o Now an binary image is save also when an error occurs.
o sourceHotCode() is using environment 'job' now and not the parent one.


Version: 0.3.1 [2005-03-10]
o Added argument 'remove=TRUE' to sourceHotCode() to remove source code
  files afterwards.
o Now only sourced hot code is written to log, otherwise the log file
  would grow unnecessarily large when calling sourceHotCode() often
  and when no hot code existed. Updated sourceDirectory() too.


Version: 0.3.0 [2005-03-09]
o BUG FIX: Filenames with '&' are invalid when calling bitmap(),
  which pngDevice() in the JobBatch example *may* do on some
  systems.
o BUG FIX: getSummary() gave an error for empty directories.
o BUG FIX: copyFrom() would not create empty directories.
o Added sourceHotCode() to hot-plugin source code while processing
  job. This method has to be called explicitly in onRun(). Errors
  that occurs *while* sourcing the hot code are logged and skipped
  with a warning. Added a hot patch to the job02 in the JobBatch
  example.


Version: 0.2.4 [2005-03-07]
o Update the job batch example to search for a working PNG device.
  This is needed on Unix where png(), which requires X11 by default,
  is only available in interactive mode and not when running in
  batch mode. When png() is not available, bitmap(), which utilizes
  ghostscript, can be used. See ?bitmap for more details.


Version: 0.2.3 [2005-03-02]
o Now copyFrom() in JobBatch takes the argument 'conlflicts', which
  is more general than former 'overwrite'.
o Now log files and sinks are sent to output/ by default. This will
  make it much easier to get an overview of the status of all jobs.
  This will lower the need for the user to open the job directory,
  which in turn will lower the risk for the directory to be locked
  when trying to move it.
o Added argument 'sink' to getRunAndFinishJob() in order to sink Job 
  output to file. To do this methods sink() and unsink() was added 
  to the Job class.
o Added command line argument '--sink', which defaults to TRUE.
o Now getLabel() returns <dirname>_<user>@<host> by default.


Version: 0.2.2 [2005-03-01]
o BUG FIX: saveImage() in Job used a non-existing reference variable.
o Now main() close all open devices after running job, if called
  in a non-interactive environment.
o onFinally() will by default close all open devices.
o Removed "internal" functions getOutputPath() and getInputPath()
  that took no arguments, and replaced them with corresponding
  methods in class Job. These can be called using the 'job' object
  passed as the first argument to onRun() etc.
o Now getLabel() in Job returns the basename of the job directory
  as a prefix. This will help identify which the job is.
o Renamed getSrc() in JobBatch to getSrcPath() and similar for 
  the others. Before getOutput() in JobBatch corresponded to 
  getOutputPath() in Job.


Version: 0.2.1 [2005-02-23]
o Added "useful" scripts RJobBatch and RJobBatch.bat.
o Added JobBatch$main() to be called from the command line.
o Added one job that will generate an error to the JobBatch 
  example to illustrate the effect of errors. Another job with a
  syntax error was added to illustrate a example of erroneous code.
o Now the JobBatch example creates a 'job-ex' directory and not
  a 'job', because there was a risk that the user used that 
  directory.
o BUG FIX: The JobBatch example was referering to R.jobs rather
  than R.batch. This would result in a huge batch directory.
o BUG FIX: Detected failure of setup(), but since the return()
  was inside a tryCatch(), it only returned from the latter
  making the code continue to onStart() and so on.


Version: 0.2.0 [2005-02-19]
o Got a complete example based on Martin Maechler's Mandelbrot
  functions.


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-02-18]
o Made into a package.


Version: 0.0 [summer 2004]
o Created scripts to run batch jobs on 30+ computers at
  the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Lund University.
  This was for my dissertation.
