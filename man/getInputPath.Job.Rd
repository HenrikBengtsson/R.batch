 \title{Gets the input path of the job}

 \description{
  Gets the input path of the job.
  It is recommended to put data files here, which should be read
  by the job.

  The input path should be named \code{"input/"}. In order to read data
  from two different directories, additional input paths may be
  \code{"input2/"}, \code{"input3/"} etc. These are specified using the
  \code{index} argument. This makes it possible to "import" data from
  the output of various other batch jobs via links.
 }

 \usage{
\method{getInputPath}{Job}(this, index=1, ...)
}

 \arguments{
  \item{index}{An \code{\link[base]{integer}} specifying which input path to query.}
  \item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
  Returns a \code{\link[base]{character}} string.
 }

   For more information see \code{\link{Job}}.
