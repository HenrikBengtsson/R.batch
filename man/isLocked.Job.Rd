\title{Checks if a job is locked}

\description{
  Checks if a job is locked either by this \code{Job} object or another.
  A job is defined to be locked if an \emph{unremovable} lock file
  (\code{.lock}) exists. This function will try to delete the lock file
  before checking in order to avoid forgotten or false lock files.
}

}

\arguments{
 \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
 Returns \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}} if job is locked, otherwise \code{\link[base:logical]{FALSE}}.
}
